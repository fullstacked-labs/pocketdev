## Why testing on your phone is so frustrating

If you have ever tried opening your local Next.js, Vite, Remix, or Astro site on a real iPhone or Android phone, you have probably run into one of these headaches:

### 1. Your phone doesn't update when you save code (or gets blocked completely)
Normally, when you edit code on your laptop, your browser updates automatically without losing your place (often called Fast Refresh or Hot Reload).

But if you try opening your dev server on your phone through normal tunnels or your local Wi-Fi IP, Next.js and Vite block the connection for security. You end up with a red error screen:
```text
Blocked cross-origin request to Next.js dev resource...
To allow this host in development, add it to "allowedDevOrigins" in next.config.js
```
Or Vite shows:
```text
Blocked request. This host is not allowed.
```
Or Next.js Server Actions crash when submitting a form:
```text
Error: Invalid Server Actions request.
```
Editing config files or whitelisting temporary URLs breaks git branches, messes up your teammates, and stops working the moment you switch Wi-Fi networks.

### 2. Your phone's camera, microphone, and voice dictation refuse to work
Mobile Safari (iPhone) and Chrome (Android) have a strict security rule: **they refuse to turn on your microphone or camera unless the website has a real, trusted HTTPS padlock.**

If you load your site using your Wi-Fi address (like `http://192.168.1.50:3000`), the phone treats it as an untrusted site:
* `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` is `undefined`.
* Speech-to-Text, voice dictation, and camera features crash instantly.
* WebCrypto (token signing) and FaceID/TouchID (Passkeys) are disabled.

Setting up self-signed certificates (`mkcert`) on an iPhone requires emailing certificate files to yourself, installing an iOS Configuration Profile, and digging through *Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings*. Over 90% of developers give up.

### 3. Cafe and office Wi-Fi blocks your phone from seeing your laptop
In coffee shops, airports, and offices, routers turn on "Client Isolation" for guest security. That means your phone and your laptop are forbidden from talking to each other directly, even on the same Wi-Fi.

## How devhop makes it work

`devhop` connects your phone to your laptop through an instant, outgoing tunnel and quietly adjusts the request labels along the way:

```
┌─────────────────┐       HTTPS       ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  iPhone Safari  │ ────────────────▶ │ *.trycloudflare.com (Edge)  │
└─────────────────┘                   └─────────────────────────────┘
                                                     │
                                                     ▼ HTTP
                                      ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                                      │      devhop Micro-Proxy     │
                                      │ (Makes it look like loopback)│
                                      └─────────────────────────────┘
                                                     │
                                                     ▼ Localhost
                                      ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                                      │ Next.js / Vite (Port 3000)  │
                                      └─────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Instant trusted link**: Creates a temporary HTTPS link via Cloudflare's edge. Your phone sees a genuine, trusted security padlock.
2. **Framework friendly**: Relabels incoming requests so Next.js and Vite think your phone is just a regular browser tab running directly on your laptop. No red error screens, no config editing.
3. **Live updates on save**: Preserves the live WebSocket connection so your phone screen refreshes instantly when you save code.
4. **Logins & cookies stay intact**: Rewrites redirect links and strips `localhost` cookie restrictions so login flows and session cookies work naturally on your phone.
5. **Survives server restarts**: If Vite or Next.js reboots while you're working, `devhop` recovers automatically without dropping your tunnel or making you scan a new QR code.

## What features unlock on your phone?

Because `devhop` provides a genuine HTTPS connection, modern mobile Web APIs work on your real device on the first try:

| Feature | Using Wi-Fi IP (`http://192.168.x.x`) | Using `npx devhop` | What you can test |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Microphone (`getUserMedia`)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | Speech-to-Text dictation, voice notes, audio recorders |
| **Camera (`getUserMedia`)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | QR/barcode scanning, photo uploads, video capture |
| **FaceID / TouchID (Passkeys)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | Biometric login flows |
| **WebCrypto (`crypto.subtle`)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | Client-side encryption and JWT auth tokens |
| **1-Click Copy (`navigator.clipboard`)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | Copy-to-clipboard buttons |
| **"Add to Home Screen" (PWA)** | ❌ Blocked | ✅ **Works** | Testing full-screen PWA installs on iOS |

## Quickstart

Run directly without installing:

```bash
# Auto-detects your active dev server (Next.js, Vite, Astro, Nuxt, etc.)
npx devhop

# Or pass a port number
npx devhop 3000

# Or paste whatever your terminal printed
npx devhop http://localhost:5173
npx devhop localhost:3000
npx devhop 0.0.0.0:4321
```

### Options

```text
npx devhop                   Auto-detect active dev server port
npx devhop [target]          Expose port, host:port, or URL with QR code
npx devhop [target] --no-qr  Expose target without printing QR code
npx devhop [target] --json   Output tunnel JSON (for AI agents & scripts)
npx devhop [target] --http2  Route tunnel over HTTP/2 (corporate firewall bypass)
npx devhop --help            Show help message
npx devhop --version         Show version
```

### Corporate firewall bypass

On office or cafe networks where UDP/QUIC is blocked, `cloudflared` may fail to connect. Force the tunnel over TCP port 443 instead:

```bash
npx devhop 3000 --http2
```

## AI Agent Integration

`devhop` is designed so AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OMP) can launch and manage mobile previews for you:
* **`skill.md`**: Follows the Agent Skills standard so coding agents know when and how to test your app on mobile.
* **`llms.txt`**: Machine-readable reference for LLM tools.
* **`--json` Flag**: Run `npx devhop 3000 --json` for structured, non-interactive output:
  ```json
  {"url":"https://example.trycloudflare.com","target":"http://127.0.0.1:3000","port":3000,"host":"127.0.0.1"}
  ```
